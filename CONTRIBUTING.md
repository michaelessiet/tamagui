## Set up your development environment

Since Tamagui is a monorepo it's quite easy to contribute to which ever part you're interested in, just go to the particular directory and you're set. To set up your development environment you'll first need clone the Tamagui repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui
```

This might take some time depending on your internet speed. Once it's done run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```
