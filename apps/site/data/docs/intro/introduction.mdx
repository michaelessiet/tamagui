### `tamagui`

The highest level part of Tamagui is `tamagui` itself, a complete UI kit built on top of `@tamagui/core`. This gives you a huge amount of progress towards a beautiful, fully working app consisting of some of the hardest components to get right, all done in a way that gives you control over their styling.

### `@tamagui/static`

`@tamagui/static` is an optimizing compiler for React that does much more than just extracting CSS styles. It significantly speeds up the runtime of apps by flattening your styled views as their call-sites, handling even tricky dynamic styles there, and outputting a `div` (on the web) or `View` (on native). <small>[Read more](/docs/compiler/why-a-compiler)</small>
