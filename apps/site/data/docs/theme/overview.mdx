## Quick start

To get started quickly, you can use the themes we've developed alongside this site and with other apps, `@tamagui/themes`. It's even easier to see how it all comes together by using [create-tamagui to bootstrap](/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app).

To install, just import it and add it to your `tamagui.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { color, radius, size, space, themes, zIndex } from '@tamagui/themes'
import { createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  size,
  space,
  zIndex,
  color,
  radius,
})

const config = createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  // ... see Configuration
})

export type Conf = typeof config

declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default config
```

<Notice>
  If you want to customize the starter themes, we recommend you just grab the `src` for
  `@tamagui/themes` and copy/paste it into your app, and customize from there.
