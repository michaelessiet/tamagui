description: How to set up Tamagui with Vite
---

In this guide we will walk you through the steps needed for you to get Tamagui integrated into your React Vite app.

In case you would like a full-featured example, you can create a new app using `npm create tamagui@latest` and select the 'Simple Web' option which includes a Vite setup.

{/* Tamagui now has two plugins for Vite: one that sets up everything you need to get going, and a second that adds CSS compilation. Both are included in the `@tamagui/vite-plugin` package.

For a full-featured example, you can create a new app using `npm create tamagui@latest` and select the 'Simple Web' option which includes a Vite setup. */}

### Installation

**Step 1:** Remove `"type": "module"` from your `package.json` if you have it. 

<Notice>
With `type: 'module'` mode, there was some issue with .mjs. so we removed that. But then path specific imports also break due to metro getting confused and not finding any path specific imports `.native.ts`â€‹.
</Notice>

**Step 2:** Install `@tamagui/vite-plugin`

<CodeBlockWithTabs>
  <div id='yarn'>
  ```bash margin=false
  yarn add @tamagui/vite-plugin
  ```
  </div>

  <div id='npm'>
  ```bash margin=false
  npm install @tamagui/vite-plugin
  ```
  </div>

  <div id='bun'>
  ```bash margin=false
  bun add @tamagui/vite-plugin
  ```
  </div>

  <div id='pnpm'>
  ```bash margin=false
  pnpm add @tamagui/vite-plugin
  ```
  </div>
</CodeBlockWithTabs>

**Step 3:** Update your `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { tamaguiExtractPlugin, tamaguiPlugin } from '@tamagui/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tamaguiPlugin({
      config: './src/tamagui.config.ts',
      components: ['tamagui'],
    }),
    // optional, adds the optimizing compiler:
    tamaguiExtractPlugin(tamaguiConfig),
  ],
})
```

See the [Installation](/docs/intro/installation) and [Configuration](/docs/core/configuration) docs for more on generally setting up Tamagui.
