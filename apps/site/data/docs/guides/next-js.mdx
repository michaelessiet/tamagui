description: How to set up Tamagui with Next.js
---

Running `npm create tamagui` let's you choose the `next-expo-solito` starter which is a configured Next.js app where you can take or leave whatever you want.

Take a peek at this website's [source code](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/apps/site) to see what a fully fledged Next.js website developed with Tamagui looks like.

<Notice>
  Tamagui is fully supported only in Next.js applications using pages router. You can use it in your App Router applications, however, it is not recommended to do so for production applications.
</Notice>

{/* Also check out the [source for this site](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/apps/site) to see a good example of a full featured Next.js website as well, especially the `next.config.js` and `tamagui.config.ts`. */}

## Installing Tamagui in Next.js

This guide assumes that your Next.js application is using the pages router and has typescript setup.

**Step 1:** Install all required dependencies:

<CodeBlockWithTabs>
  <div id="yarn">
    ```bash margin=false
    yarn add tamagui @tamagui/config @tamagui/next-plugin
    ```
  </div>
  <div id="npm">
    ```bash margin=false
    npm install tamagui @tamagui/config @tamagui/next-plugin
    ```
  </div>
  <div id="bun">
    ```bash margin=false
    bun add tamagui @tamagui/config @tamagui/next-plugin
    ```
  </div>
  <div id="pnpm">
    ```bash margin=false
    pnpm add tamagui @tamagui/config @tamagui/next-plugin
    ```
  </div>
</CodeBlockWithTabs>

**Step 2:** Create a `tamagui.config.ts` file in the root of your project:

```ts
import { createTamagui } from "tamagui"
import { config } from "@tamagui/config/v2-native"

const tamaguiConfig = createTamagui(config)
// this makes typescript properly type everything based on the config
type Conf = typeof tamaguiConfig
declare module "tamagui" {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default tamaguiConfig
// depending on if you chose tamagui, @tamagui/core, or @tamagui/web
// be sure the import and declare module lines both use that same name
```

**Step 3:** Configure your `next.config.js` to work with Tamagui:

```js
const { withTamagui } = require("@tamagui/next-plugin")

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
}

const tamaguiPlugin = withTamagui({
  platform: 'web',
  useReactNativeWebLite: false,
  config: "./tamagui.config.ts",
  components: ["tamagui"],
  // build-time generate CSS styles for better performance
  // we recommend only using this for production so you get reloading during dev mode
  outputCSS:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "./public/tamagui.css" : null,

  // optional advanced settings:

  // set to false if you never call addTheme or updateTheme
  // when combined with outputCSS this saves you 1Kb more bundle size
  doesMutateThemes: true,
})

module.exports = {
  ...nextConfig,
  ...tamaguiPlugin(nextConfig)
}
```

**Step 4:** In your `pages/_app.tsx` add `@tamagui/core/reset.css` to get more consistent styles across browsers, and wrap your app with the `TamaguiProvider` component:

```tsx line={2,5,6,10}
import "@/styles/globals.css"
import "@tamagui/core/reset.css"

import type { AppProps } from "next/app"
import { TamaguiProvider } from "tamagui"
import tamaguiConfig from "../../tamagui.config"

// include this only if you're using the outputCSS option
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  require('../public/tamagui.css')
}

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={tamaguiConfig}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

**Done** your project is ready to go!

### pages/\_document.tsx

You'll want to set up a `_document.tsx` and gather both the `react-native-web` style object using AppRegistry, as well as Tamagui styles using `Tamagui.getCSS()` into the head element.

Note that we only are importing `react-native` here because if you use `tamagui` views like Input or Image they rely on React Native Image/Input (and therefore on the web, `react-native-web`). If you are just using core, or aren't using Image or Input in `tamagui`, you can forego the entire `AppRegistry` import and setup here. We're working on making even `tamagui` completely de-coupled from RN/RNW by building their own image and input components eventually.

```tsx
import NextDocument, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
import { Children } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

import Tamagui from '../tamagui.config'

export default class Document extends NextDocument {
  static async getInitialProps({ renderPage }) {
    const page = await renderPage()

    // @ts-ignore RN doesn't have this type
    const rnwStyle = StyleSheet.getSheet()

    return {
      ...page,
      styles: (
        <>
          <style
            id={rnwStyle.id}
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: rnwStyle.textContent }}
          />
          <style
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
              __html: Tamagui.getCSS({
                // if you are using "outputCSS" option, you should use this "exclude"
                // if not, then you can leave the option out
                exclude: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'design-system' : null,
              }),
            }}
          />
        </>
      ),
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}
```

### Themes

We've created a package that works with Tamagui to properly support SSR light/dark themes that also respect user system preference, called `@tamagui/next-theme`. It assumes your `light`/`dark` themes are named as such, but you can override it. This is pre-configured in the create-tamagui starter.

We recommend memo-ing children so they don't re-render. Here's how you'd set up your `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import { NextThemeProvider, useRootTheme } from '@tamagui/next-theme'
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import Head from 'next/head'
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from '../tamagui.config'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useRootTheme()

  // memo to avoid re-render on dark/light change
  const contents = useMemo(() => {
    return <Component {...pageProps} />
  }, [pageProps])

  // because we do our custom getCSS() above, we disableInjectCSS here
  return (
    <>
      <Head>{/* ... */}</Head>
      <NextThemeProvider onChangeTheme={setTheme}>
        <TamaguiProvider
          config={config}
          disableInjectCSS
          disableRootThemeClass
          defaultTheme={theme}
        >
          {contents}
        </TamaguiProvider>
      </NextThemeProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

If you need to access the current theme, say for a toggle button, you will then use the `useTheme` hook. We'll release an update in the future that makes this automatically work better with Tamagui's built-in `useTheme`.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@tamagui/next-theme'

export default () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme()
  return <Button>Change theme (currently: {theme})</Button>
}
```

### Mount animations

Animations that run through JS drivers and have `enterStyle` set will want to add the following script that allows for hiding those animations before the JS runs. This is the "right way" to handle things, as it allows for disabling JS entirely and not accidentally hiding all unmounted things. Meanwhile, it still properly avoids a flash of mounted style for SSR pages.

Add this to your `_app.tsx` render output:

```tsx
<NextHead>
  <script
    key="tamagui-animations-mount"
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      // avoid flash of animated things on enter
      __html: `document.documentElement.classList.add('t_unmounted')`,
    }}
  />
</NextHead>
```

### Server components

Tamagui includes Server Components support for the Next.js app directory. It should work fully server side eventually, but we have to work with the Next.js team to figure out the final steps here. Until then, `use client` support is here already.

Create a new component:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useServerInsertedHTML } from 'next/navigation'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

export function NextTamaguiProvider({ children }) {
  useServerInsertedHTML(() => {
    // this first time this runs you'll get the full CSS including all themes
    // after that, it will only return CSS generated since the last call
    return <>{Tamagui.getNewCSS()}</>
  })

  // see Tamagui provider setup in the example above
  return <TamaguiProvider>{children}</TamaguiProvider>
}
```

The new `getNewCSS` helper in Tamagui will keep track of the last call and only return new styles generated since the last usage.

And then use it in your `app/layout.tsx` like this:

```tsx
import { NextTamaguiProvider } from './NextTamaguiProvider'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <NextTamaguiProvider>{children}</NextTamaguiProvider>
}
```

Additionally, you will need to add the `skipNextHead` prop to your `<NextThemeProvider>`, as the internal usage of `next/head` is not supported in the app directory.

And you'll need to pass the `appDir` boolean to `@tamagui/next-plugin`:

```tsx
withTamagui({
  appDir: true,
})
```
