Tamagui components aim to make cross-platform UI development seamless by giving developers the ability to share their components between their native and web apps.

On native, component styles output to `Stylesheet.create`, and on the web, outputs to classNames that generate CSS on the fly. However, you can opt out of just-in-time compilation by setting up the [optimizing compiler](/docs/compiler/why-a-compiler) that analyzes and outputs your styles at build time.
