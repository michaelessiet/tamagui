title: Tamagui Props
description: All the properties supported on base Tamagui components.
---

Tamagui uses a superset of the style properties that are supported in React Native and React Native Web, and flattens them onto the direct properties of Stack and Text ([see why below](#why-its-important)). So you can write:

```tsx
import { Stack } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => <Stack padding={10} backgroundColor="red" />
```

For the full list of style and non-style props, see:

- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), or
- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props)

You may also want to reference the [react-native-web docs](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/) for more on props related to:

- [Localization](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/localization/)

Tamagui adds a few extra props, [read those below](#tamagui-props).

### Order is important

Tamagui props are sensitive to their order - a very nice feature, that without which would leave you with impossible styling challenges. Let's first explain how it works, and then why it's necessary.

Define a new styled component:

```tsx
const CalHeader = styled(Text, {
  variants: {
    isHero: {
      true: {
        fontSize: 36,
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
        color: 'white',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

And then use it in a view you're building:

```tsx
export const MyCalendar = (props: { isHero?: boolean; headerFontSize?: number }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {/* ... some other components... */}
      <CalHeader isHero={props.isHero} fontSize={props.headerFontSize}>
        {monthName}
      </CalHeader>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Why it's important

Notice two things: `isHero` sets a variety of properties, but you want to allow overriding one of those properties, `fontSize`.

If Tamagui didn't respect the order of the props on the JSX element of `CalHeader`, you wouldn't know if the `isHero` font size wins, or if the `headerFontSize` wins.

CSS does a "last defined style wins", which is a huge pain because it means you have to carefully manage the order your CSS is actually loaded into the document. Tamagui could do something similar, with a "inline props always win, defined props go in order of definition", but this would be dramatically less flexible.

Especially when it comes to spreading props downwards. Because Tamagui supports prop order, you have complete control over which styles you want to always win, vs which can be overridden by a user:

```tsx
export const MyCalendarHeader = (props: CalHeaderProps) => {
  return (
    <CalHeader isHero {...props} fontSize={36}>
      {monthName}
    </CalHeader>
  )
}
```

This component defaults to `isHero` styles, but if a user passes in `isHero` as `false`, it will disable all those styles. But because `fontSize` is **always** after the spread, it will always be set to 36.

### Tamagui props

Outside of flat style properties, Tamagui adds the following props:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'theme',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          Apply a theme or sub-theme to this component and the components below it.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'themeInverse',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: (
        <span>
          Invert light or dark theme for the sub-tree.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'themeShallow',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: (
        <span>
          Used in combination with the theme prop, it prevents the theme from passing to children.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'className',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: An escape hatch to set className. This works fully with the compiler, which will concat your defined className with its generated ones.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'tag',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: Renders the final element as the given tag.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'space',
      required: false,
      type: "boolean | string | TamaguiConfig['space']",
      description: (
        <span>
          Spacing is built into Tamagui and can accept a number or Token.space value. This will
          filter out any nullish child elements and insert a spacer components between the remaining
          elements.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'spaceDirection',
      required: false,
      default: 'both',
      type: `'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'both'`,
      description: (
        <span>
          By default the space inserted is a square, but if you set it to horizontal it will be 0px tall, vertical will be 0px wide.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'separator',
      required: false,
      type: "React.ReactNode",
      description: (
        <span>
          Insert a custom separator between every child. If space is provided, the separator will appear with a space on either side.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'fullscreen',
      required: false,
      type: `boolean`,
      description: <span>Sets position absolute, and top, left, right, and bottom all to 0.</span>,
    },

    {
      name: 'debug',
      required: false,
      type: `boolean | 'verbose' | 'break'`,
      description: (
        <span>
          When set Tamagui will output a variety of helpful information on how it parsed and
          applied styling. Verbose will output more information, and break will hit a debugger at
          the start of render in development mode.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'asChild',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean | "except-style"',
      description: (
        <span>
          When true, Tamagui expects a single child element. Instead of rendering its own element, it will pass all props to that child, merging together any event handling props. When "except-style", the same behavior except Tamagui won't pass styles down from the parent, only non-style props.
        </span>
      ),
    },

]}
/>

### Text props

Text adds the additional Text-specific props from [React Native Web](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props).

### Flat transform properties

For styling, Tamagui adds flattened transform properties, pseudo states and media queries:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'x',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ translateX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'y',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ translateY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scale',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scale }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'perspective',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ perspective }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scaleX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scaleX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scaleY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scaleY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'skewX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ skewX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'skewY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ skewY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'matrix',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ matrix }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotate',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotate }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateZ',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateZ }]',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Pseudo style props

Support for `hoverStyle`, `pressStyle`, and `focusStyle` is helpful as it turns what typically is complex stateful code into pure CSS on web, and a more performant StyleSheet.create (compared to inline styles) for native. They can be used with media queries as well.

```tsx
<Text color="red" hoverStyle={{ color: 'blue' }} />
```

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'hoverStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
      description: 'Web only: Applies the given style on hover',
    },
    {
      name: 'pressStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
      description: 'Applies the given style on press',
    },
    {
      name: 'focusStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
      description: 'Applies the given style on focus',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Parent based styling

Tamagui has a variety of ways to style a child based on the "parent", a parent being one of: platform, screen size, theme, or group. All of these styles use the same pattern, they use a `$` prefix for their styles, and they nest styles as a sub-object.

For example you can target `$theme-light`, `$platform-ios`, or `$group-header`. For screen size, which we call media queries, they have no prefix. Instead you define media queries on `createTamagui`. For example, if you define a media query named `large`, then `$large` is the prop name.

These parent style props accept all the Tamagui style props in their value object.

#### Media query

Based on whatever media queries you define in `createTamagui`, you can now use any of them to apply styling on native and web using the `$` prefix.

If you defined your media query like:

```tsx
createTamagui({
  media: {
    sm: { maxWidth: 800 },
  },
})
```

Then you can use it like:

```tsx
<Text color="red" $sm={{ color: 'blue' }} />
```

### Theme

Theme style props let you style a child based on a parent theme. At the moment, they only can target your top level themes, so if you have `light`, and `light_subtle` themes, then only `light` can be targeted.

Use them like so:

```tsx
<Text $theme-dark={{ color: 'white' }} />
```

### Platform

Platform style props let you style a child based on the platform the app is running on. This can be one of `ios`, `android`, `web`, or `native` (ios and android).

Use it like so:

```tsx
<Text $platform-ios={{ color: 'white' }} />
```

### Group

Groups are a new feature in beta that lets you define a named group, and then style children based whether they are inside a parent that is given that group name.

A short example:

```tsx
<Stack group="header">
  <Text $group-header={{ color: 'white' }} />
</Stack>
```

This will make the Text turn white, as it's inside a parent item with `group` set to the matching `header` value.

Group styles also allow for targeting the parent pseudo state:

```tsx
<Stack group="card">
  <Text $group-card-hover={{ color: 'white' }} />
</Stack>
```

Now only when the parent Stack is hovered the Text will turn white. The allowed psuedo modifiers are `hover` (web only), `press`, and `focus`.

To make this typed, you need to set `TypeOverride` alongside the same area you set up your Tamagui types:

```tsx
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}

  // if you want types for group styling props, define them like so:
  interface TypeOverride {
    groupNames(): 'a' | 'b' | 'c'
  }
}
```

#### Group Container

The final feature of group styles is the ability to style a child only when the parent is of a certain size. On the web these are known as "container queries", which is what Tamagui outputs as CSS under the hood. They look like this:

```tsx
<Stack group="card">
  <Text
    $group-card-sm={{ color: 'white' }}
    $group-card-sm-hover={{ color: 'green' }}
  />
</Stack>
```

Now the Text will be white, but only when the Stack matches the media query `sm`. This uses the same media query breakpoints you defined in `createTamagui({ media })`. You can see it also works with pseudo styles!

_A note on group containers and native_

On Native, we don't have access to the layout of a React component as it first renders. Only once we get the dimensions from the `onLayout` callback after the first render are we able to apply group container styles.

Because of this, we've done two things.

First, there's a new property `untilMeasured`:

```tsx
<Stack group="card" untilMeasured="hide">
  <Text
    $group-card-sm={{
      color: 'white',
    }}
  />
</Stack>
```

This takes two options, `show` or `hide`. If unset it defaults to `show`, which means it will render before it measures. With `hide` set, the container will be set to `opacity` 0 until it finishes measuring.

Alternatively, if you know the dimensions your container will be up-front, you can set width and height on the container. When either of these are set, the children will attempt to use these values on first render and if they satisfy the media query, you'll avoid the need for a double render altogether.

### Press events

Press events come along for easy single-touch events:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'onPress',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: PressEvent) => void',
    },
    {
      name: 'onPressIn',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: PressEvent) => void',
    },
    {
      name: 'onPressOut',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: PressEvent) => void',
    },
    {
      name: 'onLongPress',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: PressEvent) => void',
      description: 'Native only: no distinction on web between long press and click',
    },
  ]}
/>

Note: Internally Tamagui Stack and Text implement press events through [React Native Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) - which includes some important details on how it works.

### Hover events

Tamagui adds events above the typical react-native/react-native-web View/Text props. These are:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'onHoverIn',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: HoverEvent) => void',
      description: 'Web only: maps to onMouseEnter',
    },
    {
      name: 'onHoverOut',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: HoverEvent) => void',
      description: 'Web only: maps to onMouseLeave',
    },

]}
/>
