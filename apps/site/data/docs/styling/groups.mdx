description: A way to reactively style your components based on their parents group name.

Groups are a new feature in beta that lets you define a named group, and then style children based whether they are inside a parent that is given that group name.

A short example:

```tsx
<Stack group="header">
  <Text $group-header={{ color: 'white' }} />
</Stack>
```

This will make the Text turn white, as it's inside a parent item with `group` set to the matching `header` value.

Group styles also allow for targeting the parent pseudo state:

```tsx
<Stack group="card">
  <Text $group-card-hover={{ color: 'white' }} />
</Stack>
```

Now only when the parent Stack is hovered the Text will turn white. The allowed psuedo modifiers are `hover` (web only), `press`, and `focus`.

To make this typed, you need to set `TypeOverride` alongside the same area you set up your Tamagui types:

```tsx
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}

  // if you want types for group styling props, define them like so:
  interface TypeOverride {
    groupNames(): 'a' | 'b' | 'c'
  }
}
```

#### Group Container

The final feature of group styles is the ability to style a child only when the parent is of a certain size. On the web these are known as "container queries", which is what Tamagui outputs as CSS under the hood. They look like this:

```tsx
<Stack group="card">
  <Text
    $group-card-sm={{ color: 'white' }}
    $group-card-sm-hover={{ color: 'green' }}
  />
</Stack>
```

Now the Text will be white, but only when the Stack matches the media query `sm`. This uses the same media query breakpoints you defined in `createTamagui({ media })`. You can see it also works with pseudo styles!

_A note on group containers and native_

On Native, we don't have access to the layout of a React component as it first renders. Only once we get the dimensions from the `onLayout` callback after the first render are we able to apply group container styles.

Because of this, we've done two things.

First, there's a new property `untilMeasured`:

```tsx
<Stack group="card" untilMeasured="hide">
  <Text
    $group-card-sm={{
      color: 'white',
    }}
  />
</Stack>
```

This takes two options, `show` or `hide`. If unset it defaults to `show`, which means it will render before it measures. With `hide` set, the container will be set to `opacity` 0 until it finishes measuring.

Alternatively, if you know the dimensions your container will be up-front, you can set width and height on the container. When either of these are set, the children will attempt to use these values on first render and if they satisfy the media query, you'll avoid the need for a double render altogether.
